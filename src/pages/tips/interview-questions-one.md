The fact that you’ve made it to the interview stage is a huge milestone - congratulations. It means something about your Resume or your Cover letter caught the attention of the hiring team. Now at this stage, all you have to do is demonstrate further how you will be a fit for this role and learn more about the company and the role. Interviews are a two-sided process, remember that. 

So, the interview is an opportunity for the hiring team to get to know you better. You have control over the messages and narrative about yourself. 

## Tell me about yourself
Probably the most important question of all. Also the one people tend to answer poorly. The good news here is that you can really stand out of the crown if you answer this one well! 
Also, if you have time to prepare for just one question - this should be the one.
Pro tip: help the recruiter/hiring manager understand how your experience is relevant to the role. Explain why the experience you mention in your introduction is relevant, by pointing out its relevance to the job requirements. 

## What is your salary expectation
Soon it will become mandatory for companies to list the salary range on the position they advertise. Some already started doing that, while other companies don’t have it. For the former, your response would naturally be within the salary range listed (usually). For the latter - you can feel free to ask about the range during the interview. 

## Why should we hire you?
Here you should reiterate strong sides of your application - based on the job requirements that are in the job description. You can also mention some soft skills that you think are very relevant.
 
## Why do you want to work at this company?
This question requires reading more about the company and really figuring out what has caught your attention? Are you a fan of their product? Did you like what you have read/heard about their culture? Do you know a specific person on the leadership team or immediate team you’d like to work with/work for? Do you like their size/growth potential/industry?
