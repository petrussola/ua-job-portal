In [Part One](https://www.businessjobs.eu/tips/interview-questions-one) of these series we covered a few fundamental questions usually asked at the job interview.
- Tell me about yourself
- Why should we hire you?
- Why do you want to work at this company?
- What is your salary expectation

Let’s continue with other typical questions that are usually asked and recommendations on how to answer them. 

## Why are you leaving your current job?
It’s okay to be honest here, but try not to speak bad about the previous company or previous manager. 

## What is your greatest professional achievement
This is your time to shine. Prepare an example from your past experience that matches the job requirements of the position you’re interviewing for. Explain the context, what you did and, most importantly, what was the result. All three components are equally important.

## Tell me about a challenge you faced at work, and how you dealt with it.
What they are trying to understand here is how you deal with difficult situations. Explain how you faced challenges in the past, what were your actions and what was the result. 

## Tell me about a time you made a mistake
Speak about the time things didn’t work out in your professional career. Reflect on what went wrong and most importantly how you learned from this mistake. 

## What are you looking for in a new position?
This question is your chance to be honest about your preferences and check whether this position will be suitable for you. 

In Part Three we’ll cover the questions you should ask at the end of the interview.
